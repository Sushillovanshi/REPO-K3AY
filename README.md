**Network Port Scanner using Python**
**📌 Project Overview**

This project is a Python-based Network Port Scanner created for cybersecurity learning purposes. It scans a target IP address or domain to identify open TCP ports, helping understand how network services are exposed and discovered during network reconnaissance.
Port scanning is a fundamental technique used by SOC analysts, penetration testers, and attackers to analyze a system's security posture.
